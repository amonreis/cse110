Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

- When I started this course, I first learned that there are actually 4 different types of 
- functions (Built-in functions; Standard library functions; Third-party functions; User-defined functions),
- and I realized that I already knew and used some of those functions. but I really wanted to learn more 
- of the Python built-in functions. When I also understood concepts like "modules", "methods", and "parameters", 
- the idea of writing and calling functions seemed to make more sense to me. I experienced the power of functions
- when I was working in a program where I had to write functions where each one would create sentences by 
- randomly choosing an article, a noun, a verb, a preposition, an adjective, and an adverb, and at the end write a 
- function that would put all these functions together in a single sentence. Breaking up my program into functions,
- each one performing one single task, accepting parameters, and returning a value truly enchanted me.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

- Testing functions help me not only verify that my functions and my program run, 
- but also help me know that each function I create will do what it is supposed to do.
- Test functions also help me quickly find errors in my program so I can fix them so they work properly.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

- The process I would go through to find and fix an error in a program would be to first run the program to see if 
- the problem is a syntax error. After that, I would use the debugger tool and breakpoints to find the specific problem. 
- Lastly, I would create a testing function program to test each function in my program to see if they are producing the correct results.
- One thing I could do to improve this process would be to improve my ability to write testing functions 
- to fix logic errors which are the ones I believe I make the most.
